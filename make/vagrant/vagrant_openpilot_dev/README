vagrant_openpilot_dev - provides a Vagrant box with everything needed to compile OpenPilot code base. 

username: vagrant
password: vagrant

For details of an OpenPilot development environment please refer to the Development Manual https://wiki.openpilot.org/display/WIKI/OpenPilot+Developer+Manual.

To enable Android Studio and Java, edit file install-tools.sh and set ANDROID_ENV=true. You might also want to adjust for the versions it downloads.

If you would like for VirtualBox window to open, this can be useful for running apps, set 'vb.gui = true' in Vagrantfile. 

Starting

$ vagrant up

Once your machine has started up you can ssh into it or log into Xfce (assuming you set vb.gui = true). Any changes you make persist in the Vagrant VM, when you are done run 'vagrant halt', this will turn off the vm and persist your changes.

$ vagrant ssh

To begin with Openpilot base source is checked out into ~/workspace/openpilot/OpenPilot. Run the following command to get the rest of the tools in place (this will take a bit of time):

  make all_sdk_install

You are now ready to browse the code.

If you wish to start all over:
$ vagrant halt 
$ vagrant destroy
